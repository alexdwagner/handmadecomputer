After almost a month of hiatus from the project, I'm diving back in to the project. Thanks to many great friends who gave thoughtful feedback, I think we can now step forward toward completion. 

Story

- How to balance the technical description, narrative consistency and artistic voice? If the piece is a facet to many interesting perspective to computation, how to prevent over explaining or sticking in the details? On the other hand, how to avoid skipping through critical information that the reader needs to comprehend and enjoy the piece?  
- The piece is missing an ending, resolution of anything. The big question is what kind of computer do I want to build? some leads will make the reading more satisfactory. 
- The unclear voice of narrator: who is the narrator? if it is taeyoon ? if so. would it help for him to be a stick figure? or mr transistor? i guess it depends on the ideal reader for this piece. it's not really meant for young audience, so making it any more cuter won't really help...


Aesthetics + style

- Consistency of style can help readers concentrate on the contents. Small adjustment, of making each chapter look in similar style can help. Especially typed words between the images are big distraction. 
- at the moment, the images are applied without resizing- this is the time to begin editing images/ mocking up . 

Introduction

- The very first image "This is a story about..." is color. use original?
- I do highlight that "it's possible through abstraction and repeptition" but don't follow up with how those actually work in the following chapters. Maybe connect the contents (like how transistors are used to make logic gates) to these two concepts as much as possible? 
- "The last compuiters mayube human as well" is confusing. already feels like an ending. maybe save this for the final chapter? 
- The three figures that are dancing together, Laptop person, Human person, Transistor person - are they different characters? if so, can they have different voice?, for example their voices are rendered differently? or each chapter is clearly narrated by different figure? 
- Dahan "The intro makes me want to hear how your proposal that abstraction and repetition allows for in-between states."
- Kyle "Smart watch vs Data center" comparison might not be effective  
- The color gradation in the first chapter seems to work well, catching reader's attention. New contents for the chapter one needs to be rendered in the same style. The last few drawings, done in black and white, look out of place.
-  I wonder if it's realistic to code the background to change color from complete black to white over time. I think that works well with the idea of analog transitions, the world is not binary and there are numbers between zero and one. 
-  Still not sure what to do with all the references.
