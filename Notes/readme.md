Lately, I’ve been focusing on hand building a computer. The project is as much about the research and thinking that culminates in writing and drawing, as well as actual building of a mixed signal(analog & digital) electronic computer from discrete components, logic gate I.C.s and FPGA. It’s an attempt to challenge the common understanding of computers, rethink our relation to it and envision an alternative.

Since I’ll be showing it publicly in a museum for the first time in a month, I’ve been giving more thoughts on the meaning of the hand making a computer and how it can be experienced and understood as an art project.  

You might wonder why I try reinventing the wheel?  
 
To begin, I will be flattered if you think I’m reinventing a computer. I’m nowhere near reinventing the wheel from technical point of view. I’m building modules that compute basic arithmetic functions, remembers and stores few bits of information, and automate given instructions. I’m in the process of designing control unit for CPU and data path to connect the modules in next few weeks. I will be very happy if my computer can perform “Jump If Not Zero” (thus somewhat close to Turing-complete) one day, but I don’t dare to build a fully programmable 8 bit computer. There are others who’ve done it (thus the wheel has been reinvented quiet frequently by engineers and hobbyists alike) and the technical achievement is only one part of the project. I’m more interested in unveiling abstractions at each level of technical production, mechanical computer to electronic computer and from hardware to software to cloud. Also the history of evolution from completely abstract machines inside of Logician’s head and sketch pad, Shannon’s theory of using Relays to perform Boolean Logic, Information theory and feedback, to contemporary research of evolutionary computing fascinates me. The strange balance of my technical naiveté and curiosity keeps me pursuing this project. It shouldn’t be any surprise that I’m also inspired by the counter culture of 1960s and the community of makers who build their own tools, building telescopes, toasters, green houses and etc.  

The most important aspect of the project is 1. learning and explaining the fundamentals of computation to the general (art) audience, because I think computation is beautiful and it should not be kept secret 2. challenging the notion of computer as a commodity object, by opening up the mysterious black box and making it my own.
 
The computers are very human-like, they are designed by humans in the first place. They are just an unlikely kind to be easily friends. Computation and technology is not something to be afraid of, or to overtly celebrate, blindly cheerleading the Silicon Valley anthem towards the next generation products.
  
What’s wrong with the wheel? 

The computers that surround us today are built in a similar way like how the Fast Foods are prepared. As a consumer, this concerns me a great deal that the alternatives are scarce and out of reach. The alternatives in software and contents are widely available, including Linux based operating systems, and open source software. While even the D/I.Y computer hardwares are most of the time comprised of off the shelf parts. The computers are the products of 20th century politics and values, Fordism and mass production, Militarization and the system of control.

The increasing mystery behind “how” things are made is due to miniaturization and mass production. Also commodification of technology and tools is further dividing the gap between production and consumption. This mixed causes lead to humans to become agents of the machines, instead of humans using tools and instruments to perform their tasks efficiently, precisely and effortlessly. When our lives are governed and owned by the machines, algorithm and code, what is the act of resistance, dissent and independence? 

I hope I don’t sound like a techno phobic who's afraid of machines dominating our lives. I wish to shy away from the common tendencies of artists using technology to achieve the end result without understanding consequences and significance of the material, or the usual retro-mania with fairy tale idea of “all things past (analog) are beautiful”. I’m aware of added commodity values of handmade objects as well as how the computers are made by someone’s hand, just not the users own labor. 

Not questioning our relationship to the computers, consumption instead of construction, is the path of least resistance. Few of recent events highlight the effect of our ambivalence. Drone technology take away human agency in the warfare, government and private agencies steal our security measures and private information. Corporate monopoly of information technology jeopardize political and ethical neutrality.  

For the love of craft? 

The biggest inspiration for me to work with technology as a creative medium in unconventional ways is learning that “there is no conventional way” in science and engineering. While engineering is primarily based on logical thinking and scientific research is mostly based on rigid rules, restrictions and strict processes, the true essence of scientific thinking is very poetic and abstract. You can imagine logicians and mathematicians building complex machines in their hand, like building a castle out of dreams. I also think highly of people who build things from scratch. Anything made from hands, from homemade food, raising plants, herding animal, building furniture, making art, hobbyists and amateur building their tools like telescopes... in all cases, there is a shared love of craft, diligence in labor and respect for the material. 

Mathematics and logic have elegance in its abstraction and repetition, that can only be described as beautiful. While the language of machines are not easily decipherable for human, its essence can be felt and affected. This might be what people will call ‘computer feelings’ in the future. 

Personalization of computers is something that’s very much advertised as the selling point for products and services. These series of customization are in fact not true ownership of technology, as we are continuing to be dependent on consuming more products to sustain our use. 

An alternative path is “Becoming computer” an active act of learning and transforming our machines, defining its limits and uncertainties. Only when you become the thing you pursue, you can speak its language, and it can become your own. The first computers were human (person operating mathematics and recording), and the last computer will be human as well. When we become computers again, the computers will in return become closer to friendly human. 

The other projects I’m pursuing share this idea that personalization leads to intimacy and signals of affect. Questions lead to more questions. 

How can you build your own social network? - Your friend, an exhibition of correspondence and collaboration with my friends. 

How can you create your own shared database, off line and in person over distance? - Ghostbox and post postoffice.

How can you create your own master-less, slave-less clock? - In search of personalized time. 

How can you make your own un-sounding devices? - Silence generators.
