There are many ways of defining a computer other than a desktop, laptop, or any machine with a operating system that we use daily. Computer, on the fundamental level is a tool that can do mathematical operations like adding and multiplying, and also to remember information and follow an instruction.

The silicon valley folklore center around protagonists like Job, Wozniak and Gates around the myth of innovation. What is often left untold behind the glossy narrative of innovation is the militarization and mass production which is the context for computer's invention. Before the computers became personal, it was first a large machine for analytics and then a tool that's controlled through feedback for the governance of communication.

Manuel DeLanda in "War in the Age of Intelligent Machines" chronicles the development of computational technology and theory from the perspective of the military operations.

There are all beautiful states like dawn and dusk in computation as well. It's not Digital, but rather Analog. There were attempts at making Analog computers in the early stage of computer development. However, Digital computers became dominant standard quickly. Nowadays, the most interesting work in Analog computers are done in music through modular synthesizes.  Musicians like [Keith Fullerton Whitman](http://www.keithfullertonwhitman.com/)'s modular synth performances and recordings are similar to how I imagine Analog computers talk to each other.

The first computers were human, as in it was humans doing computation some numbers and keeping track of the information.

Let's begin our journey with Zeros and Ones with  Clocks and Transistors. 
There is a map for the treausre.
