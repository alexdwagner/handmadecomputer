There are many ways of defining a computer other than the desktop, laptop, or smartphone. "Computer," on the fundamental level is a tool that can do mathematical operations like add and multiply, remember information and follow an instruction.

There is a silicon valley folklore that centers around protagonists like Jobs, Wozniak, a mythology of innovation. But what's left out of this glossy narrative are stories about militarization, state power, and mass production which provided the right political conditions and then financed the computer's invention. Before computers became personal, they were simply large analytics machines and tools for automating the growing electronic communications system. [1]

Manuel DeLanda in *War in the Age of Intelligent Machines* chronicles the development of computational technology and theory from the perspective of military operations.

These dawn and dusk states can be found in computation as well. Computing that's not digital, but analog. There were attempts at making analog computers during early computer development, however, digital computers quickly became the dominant standard. Nowadays, some of the most interesting work in analog computing happens in music, through construction and performance of modular synthesizers. Musicians like [Keith Fullerton Whitman](http://www.keithfullertonwhitman.com/), whose compositions are similar to how I imagine analog computers might talk to each other.

Let's begin our journey of zeros and ones, transistors and clocks.

[1] The first computers were human. In fact, we get the term "computer" from the outmoded practice of human computation, peoples whose profession was the performance of arithmetic for scientific, logistical, or military production.
