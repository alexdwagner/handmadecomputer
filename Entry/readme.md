## Reference

[1] There are many ways of defining a computer other than the desktop, laptop, or smartphone. The "computer," on a fundamental level is a tool that can do mathematical operations like add and multiply, remember information and follow instructions. 

The first computers were human. In fact, we get the term "computer" from the outmoded practice of human computation, peoples whose profession was the performance of arithmetic for scientific, logistical, or military production.

[2] There is a silicon valley mythology that centers around protagonists like Jobs, Wozniak, the legend of innovation. But what's left out of this glossy narrative are parallel stories about militarization, state power, and mass production, which not only financed, but provided the right political conditions for the computer's invention.

Before computers became personal, they were used as tools for scientific research and engineering, as technologies to scale growing electronic communication systems and as machines for war.

Manuel DeLanda in *War in the Age of Intelligent Machines* chronicles the development of computational technology and theory from the perspective of military operations.
