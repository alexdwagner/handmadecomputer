There are many ways of defining a computer other than a desktop, laptop, or any machine with a operating system that we use daily. Computer, on the fundamental level is a tool that can do mathematical operations like adding and multiplying, and also to remember information and follow an instruction.

The silicon valley folklore center around protagonists like Job, Wozniak and Gates around the myth of innovation. What is often left untold behind the glossy narrative of innovation is the militarization and mass production which is the context for computer's invention. Before the computers became personal, it was first a large machine for analytics and then a tool that's controlled through feedback for the governance of communication.

The first computers were human, as in it was humans doing computation- like mathematics. The word computer actually is based on the etymology of 'someone doing the computation'. 

This is a segway into the chapter about the Binary, Chapter three, The World in Black and White.
