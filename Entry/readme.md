##Enter the maze  



Let's begin our journey with Zeros and Ones, Miss. Clocks and Mr. Transistor. 
There is a map for the treausre.

There are many definitions of computers. By 'computer', I don't mean a desktop, laptop, or anything like a fully functional computer with operating system.  If you are interested in making a functional modern computer, open source, look at Bunnie Hung's Open source laptop project. Instead I'm interested in questioning what a computer is on the fundamental level, and ask you to join me in rethinking it's definition by making one from scratch. I chose to make a computer with Logic Gates I.C. because it's a good place between completely raw material like mechanical computer like Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, early electronic computer with Vacuum tubes and Transistors. With working with I.C.s, I still get to learn about the computation as a theory, and also have the freedom to design and build based on architecture. Also one big caveat is that there are many resources out there to build computer from logic gates, as there was a short period in the development between completely Hardware based computer and microcontrollers, like 8080 and other programmable hardwares where people began to write software. It's also the time at the verge of mass production which lead to the idea of personal computers emerged and became popular.

Reference: 

The silicon valley folklore center around protagonists like Jobs and Wozniak, Gates and similarly mystified figures of innovation. What is often hidden behind the glossy narrative of invention and market success is the context of militarization and mass production. 

Manuel DeLanda in "War in the Age of Intelligent Machines" chronicles the development of computation technology and theory as the direct extension of military tools. Before the Personal Computers became personal, it was a tool of tabulating machines for analytics. Chargles Babbage, 

The dominating theory behind Information technology in the 20th century, cybernetics was the idea of control through feedback, and governance of communication.

The between states are the space between zero and one, the world of dawn and dusk. It's the analog numbers and representation of real numbers through the binary system. It's the representation.

There are all beautiful states like dawn and dusk. 
 

It's possible through abstraction and repetition.

The first computers were human, as in it was humans doing computation- like mathematics. The word computer actually is based on the etymology of 'someone doing the computation'. In the
