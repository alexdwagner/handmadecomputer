But setting aside the computing industry's privatization of technical knowledge for a moment, the complexities of the modern computer can be broadly understood as the product of only a few basic operations repeated and abstracted.

Both art and computation are often made opaque because access is equated with power. But just like the painting, stepping inside the computer may be easier than you think.

Opening the computer we find lots of small electronic components and a circuit board that connects them together. This is an image of a microchip from 1963 at 100x magnification.

Micrograph photos reveal the unique visual patterns of the computer's interior circuitry. Designed to maximize electronic performance at infinitesimal scale, they can also be quite geometrically appealing.

But when I look at images like these I see artworks.

Artworks like this painting by [Peter Halley](http://www.peterhalley.com/) titled *Instant City*[2]. Halley's works not only remind me of microchip designs but many other computer design patterns. In fact the term "design pattern" was introduced to computer scientists by an architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander. We'll touch on one design pattern in particular, the von Neumann architecture, in more detail when we get to the [CPU Dumpling Shop](https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/tree/master/Dumpling) chapter coming up.

I often find surprising connections between art and computation. Conceptual artists, for instance, were interested in more than just the formal qualities of the painting, such as color and shape. They were also attentive to the systems in which their work was created. Their working process emphasized making *programs*, sets of instructions that, when executed, resulted in both a performative action and production of the artwork.

Paintings and books all make use of repetition. Layering shapes or wires or pages, the composition and logic of which allow them to function as a whole.
 
This phrase "Each one comes to be a whole one to me" is from *The Making of Americans* by Gertrude Stein. I opened a random page in the book and picked this line, so it could just have been any other phrase. In this book, a story is told and retold in many ways. The result is a fragmented narrative with multiple perspectives.

Making a computer and building electronic circuits feels like building a tiny city. The circuit board is a little urban architecture and its inhabitants a busy traffic of electronic signals. Just like cities, memories are made and remembered in the buildings and roads connecting them.

We are now going to make a window into this city and peer into the world of zero and one.

We will build a 1-bit computer in the future chapter with electronics.
