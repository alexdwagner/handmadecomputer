There are some aspects of computation that's similar to visual and literary art.

And some painters's work look like the Integrated Circuits inside. This image is a painting by [Peter Halley](http://www.peterhalley.com/).

There are other artists in the Minimalists and Abstraction movement, or those inspired by such work, whose Abstract paintings remind me of the computers.

*From Model City [7] by Donna Stonecipher* 

It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and instantly feeling the burden of ownership, the keys weighing down your coat pocket so severely you start dreaming of giving them back.

*

It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and then you get into your royal blue car and drive out to the outskirts of town to leave the keys on an unoccupied bench overlooking a lake.

*

It was like dreaming that you drive back home unburdened, enter your house with its key and sit down with a sigh on your bed, in the quiet and dark, until you notice that the keys to the model city are back in your pocket.

*

It was like waking suddenly from the dream, seeing your house key on its hook, and luxuriating in the freedom from keys to model cities â€” in the deep ease of the haphazard and the habitual, the half-assed.
