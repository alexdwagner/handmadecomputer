Everyday, we look at computer screens for a very long time.

We touch it, carry it and sleep next to it.

Information is stored in bits, our messages are communicated over the network and our living spaces are  pixels. l surface we live in is build by pixels.

Most of us have some knowledge about how to use computers. However, we have a limited understanding of the inner workings of computers behind the glossy screen and colorful User Interfaces. Computers operate complex tasks and operations through a series of abstraction and repeptition.

The Minimalists painters were interested in more than just the formal qualities of the painting such as color and shape. They were also interested in the systems in which their work is created. Their working process was about making *programs*, a series of instructions that can be executed to result in an action and production.

This is a microscopic image of a chip (Resistor - Transistor Logic) from 1963. 
 flip flop [1]. Images like these, the inside of chips, reveal the visual patterns, designed for engineering purpose but nonetheless appealing and interesting geometric forms. It reminds of works of Frank Stella, Sol Lewitt

  This image is a painting by [Peter Halley](http://www.peterhalley.com/) titled Instant City[2]. Halley's works not only reminds of Chips but also computer architectures  such as the Von Neumann architecture which we will get into deeper with the CPU Dumpling Shop chapter coming up.

 And there's the repetition.

This phrase "Each one comes to be a whole one to me" is from "The Making of Americans" by Gertrude Stein. I opened a random page in the book and picked this line, so it could have been any other phrase. In this book, a very long stroy is told and retold in many ways. The result is a fragmented narrative with multiple perspectives.

Making a computer, and building an electronic circuit feels like building a tiny city. The Circuit board is the physical city and the electronic signal that travells in the wires are like the busy traffics in the city. The memories that are made and remembered in the buildings and the roads that connect them all.

 It's layered with many walls of buildings that repeat after each other.

Also, the city from far away are abstracted into a box of mass.

In this piece, we are going to cut a small hole in the box and jump into the box to the world of zero and one. 


It's a really long book, so maybe it's a good idea to look for another example that you can read quickly. *Model City* is a book of poems about cities by Donna Stonecipher. 

It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and instantly feeling the burden of ownership, the keys weighing down your coat pocket so severely you start dreaming of giving them back.

*

It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and then you get into your royal blue car and drive out to the outskirts of town to leave the keys on an unoccupied bench overlooking a lake.

*

It was like dreaming that you drive back home unburdened, enter your house with its key and sit down with a sigh on your bed, in the quiet and dark, until you notice that the keys to the model city are back in your pocket.

*

It was like waking suddenly from the dream, seeing your house key on its hook, and luxuriating in the freedom from keys to model cities â€” in the deep ease of the haphazard and the habitual, the half-assed.

*From Model City [7] by Donna Stonecipher*
