 
Everyday, we look at computer screens for a very long time.

We touch it, carry it and sleep next to it.

Information is stored in bits, our messages are communicated over the network and our living spaces are  pixels. l surface we live in is build by pixels.

Most of us have some knowledge about how to use computers. However, we have a limited understanding of the inner workings of computers behind the glossy screen and colorful User Interfaces. Computers operate complex tasks and operations through a series of abstraction and repeptition.

The Minimalists painters were interested in more than just the formal qualities of the painting such as color and shape. They were also interested in the systems in which their work is created. Their working process was about making *programs*, a series of instructions that can be executed to result in an action and production.

This is a microscopic image of a chip (Resistor - Transistor Logic) from 1963. 
 flip flop [1]. Images like these, the inside of chips, reveal the visual patterns, designed for engineering purpose but nonetheless appealing and interesting geometric forms. It reminds of works of Frank Stella, Sol Lewitt and other artists.

  This image is a painting by [Peter Halley](http://www.peterhalley.com/) titled Instant City[2]. Halley's works not only reminds of Chips but also computer architectures  such as the Von Neumann architecture which we will get into deeper with the chapter on [CPU Dumpling Shop](https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/tree/master/Dumpling) chapter coming up.

This phrase "Each one comes to be a whole one to me" is from "The Making of Americans" by Gertrude Stein. I opened a random page in the book and picked this line, so it could have been any other phrase. In this book, a stroy is told and retold in many ways. The result is a fragmented narrative with multiple perspectives.

The paintings, circuits and books, they all have layer of shapes, walls and pages that repeat after each other.

Also, like the city from far away, pages of stories are abstracted into a tale. 
We are now going to cut a small hole in to the abstracted form and jump into the world of zero and one.

Making a computer, and building an electronic circuit feels like building a tiny city. The Circuit board is the physical city and the electronic signal that travells in the wires are like the busy traffics in the city. The memories that are made and remembered in the buildings and the roads that connect them all.
