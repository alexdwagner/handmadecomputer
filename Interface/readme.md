[⇐ INTRODUCTION](https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/blob/master/Entry/readme.md)

Everyday we look at computer screens for a very long time.

We touch them, carry them, and sleep next to them.



Our lives are stored in bits, our messages turned to network packets, our living spaces are pixels.

Most of us have some knowledge about how to use a computer. But we have a limited understanding of the inner workings, what happens behind the colorful user interface. Miniaturization and mass-production have lead to the mystification of the computer, complicating, obscuring its operation and means of production.

Fortunately, computers perform all the complex tasks we're familiar with through a few simple operations, repeated and abstracted. So opening up the computer may be easier than you think.

The Minimalists painters were interested in more than just the formal qualities of the painting, such as color and shape. They were also interested in the systems in which their work was created. Their working process emphasized making *programs*, sets of instructions that, when executed, resulted in both a performative action and production of the artwork.

This is a microscopic image of a microchip (resistor-transistor flip-flop logic [1]) from 1963. Images like these reveal the visual patterns of the interior circuitry which, designed for engineering purposes, are also quite geometrically appealing. They remind me of Frank Stella, Sol Lewitt, and the work of other minimalist artists.

Josephson Junctions Chip from IBM.

This image is a painting by [Peter Halley](http://www.peterhalley.com/) titled Instant City[2]. Halley's work not only reminds me of microchips, but also computer design patterns such as the Von Neumann architecture, which we will touch on in the [CPU Dumpling Shop](https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/tree/master/Dumpling) chapter coming up.

This phrase "Each one comes to be a whole one to me" is from *The Making of Americans* by Gertrude Stein. I opened a random page in the book and picked this line, so it could have been any other phrase. In this book, a story is told and retold in many ways. The result is a fragmented narrative with multiple perspectives.

Paintings, circuits, and books all make use of repetition. Layering shapes or wires or pages, the composition and logic of which allow them to function as a whole.

We are now going to cut a small hole into the abstracted form and jump into the world of zero and one.

Making a computer and building electronic circuits feels like building a tiny city. The circuit board is a little urban architecture and its inhabitants a busy traffic of electronic signals. Just like cities, memories are made and remembered in the buildings and roads connecting them.
