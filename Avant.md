# handmade computer

This posting is for Sam and Paul who I'm working with for a piece to be published at Avant.org soon.

#Overview 

- Multimedia introduction to Handmade computer piece on Avant.org.
- Readers scroll down to view the piece, few elements react to mouse click, mouse drag and etc. 
- Media contents include plain text, drawing (jpg, gif), video (quicktime file or vimeo link), photograph (jpg). 
- Viewing/reading time- 10 minutes or less, although they may connect to other resources with more material.     
- General feeling of the piece is playful and friendly and yet critical in core points.

# Interactive 

I will need help in programming interactive elemtns of the piece. 

1. Scrolling experience
Media objects appear and disappear 
Text bubble shows up, disappear (text bubble includes my handwriting) on top of the static image. This can be very helpful for dense images like this one)

2.  The logic explanation
More information on the google doc

3. JavaScript: I will be stoked if we can use [p5.js](http://p5js.org) to make the interactive parts, because the open source community around p5 is great, and I can see the right kind of readers coming in from there. Also the piece can be featured in p5 gallery. However, I understand the library is still limited and might not be the most efficient ways of doing things.
