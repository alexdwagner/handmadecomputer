Handmade Computer: Conceptual art project about computation, craft and system. 
This repo is a currently a simple list of things, materials and media that has been made for my handmade computer project. 
Soon, I want to create a dedicated website for the project with all technical and conceptual material, including how to guides, videos and schematics.
This repo will also contain material for interviews, collaboration and etc.
