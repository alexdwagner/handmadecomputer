Handmade Computer: Conceptual art project about computation and craft. 

This repo is a currently a simple list of materials and media that has been made for my handmade computer project. 

I'm planning to create a dedicated website for the project with all technical and conceptual material, including how to guides, videos and schematics very soon.

This repo will also contain material for interviews, collaboration and etc.
