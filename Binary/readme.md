 1-Bit Computer has the basic functionality of Computers. It can add a single digit, change the speed of oscillation as a binary clock that turn on and off an LED, and a latching mechanism that can remember 1 Bit of Information.

This version of 1 Bit Computer is made of NAND Logic gates. It uses two TTL NAND Logic Chips, which are Integrated Circuit Chip that's designed to perform logical operations of NAND logic gate.

NAND logic is a short name of Not AND gate.

For AND Gate, if you are sharking 100 hands all at the same time, the result is true, or 1.

In NAND Gate, if you are declined for date by 100 person at the same time, the result is true. 

NAND logic we are using only two inputs and and only when all of the inputs are false, or 0, the result is true, or 1. 


 By combining NAND gate, we can make every other logic gates. This is called Universal Gate, because along with NOR gate, NAND can be combined to make every kind of logic.

##Half Adder 

With XOR and AND gate combined, we can make an Adder. Adder adds numbers. So in the world of Binary numbers, where every number is made of Zero and One, 
</br>
0+0=0</br>
0+1-1 </br>
1+0=1 </br>
1+1=10 </br>

The last condition where 1+1 carries over the number to the next digit is the case of AND gate, and the first digit acts like XOR gate. By combining both logic gates, we can make an adding machine.
