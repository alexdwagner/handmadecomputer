A 1-bit computer has all the fundamental abilities of the traditional computing device. It can perfom *artithmetic*, add two single digit numbers and return a two digit output. It has a *clock* that creates a square wave oscillation, turning on and off an LED at varying speed. And it has *memory*, a latch that can store 1-bit of information, a zero or a one.

This version of *1 Bit Computer* is made of NAND logic gates.

NAND is short for *not* AND logic. Here A and B are inputs, either of which can be zero or one, and Y is the logical output. In the venn diagram above depicting possible input state configurations, every shape is colored except the intersecting region. This means the result is true in every case *except* when both inputs are true.

For AND gate, if you are shaking 100 hands all at the same time, the result is a true 100-person handshake, or 1.

In a NAND gate, if you are declined for date by 100 people together, the result is a true connection. ```[this needs some work]```

But the NAND logic we are using only has two inputs, so in the case when all inputs are false, or 0, the result is true, or 1. 


By combining NAND gates in various arrangements we are able to make every other logic pattern. This is called the *universal gate*, because along with the NOR gate, NAND can be combined to map any input instruction to any output.

This 1 bit computer uses two TTL NAND logic chips, which are integrated circuit chips designed to perform NAND operations. The same logic could be implemented with transistors, vacuum tubes, or few lines of code in most programming languages.

```[we haven't given them the symbol for XOR, we may want to have a little key for all symbols or intro them one by one with the symbol.]``` With XOR and AND gates combined, we can make an adder. Adders add numbers. So in the world of binary numbers, where every number is made of zeros and ones, the output of the addition would be 10, not ten but "one, zero." 
</br>
0+0=0</br>
0+1=1 </br>
1+0=1 </br>
1+1=10 (2 in decimal notation) </br>

In the last case, where the sum of 1+1, 10 requires we carry the 1 over to the next place, the next digit is fed to the AND gate, and the first digit acts like an XOR gate. By combining both logic gates, we can make an adding machine, called a *half adder*.

The second basic computing operation is data storage, remembering information in bits. We are going to create the most primitive form of computer memory, where an input *set* can turn on or off an LED output, *Q bar*. If the reset switch is then toggled, *switch* is assigned to 1, and next time the *set* is made 1 and the LED output will remain lit even when *set* is no longer pressed. A latch works by connecting output of the NAND logic gate to input of another NAND logic gate. This is a sequential circuit, in which the output is affected by the input that was previously made. So the two inputs are called *set* and *reset* because they can be used interchangeably, a circuit like this is called a flip-flop as well.

The binary clock simply switches between zero and one, visible to us as 'LED not lit,' and then 'LED lit.' The period in which the LED blinks, or the clock cycle, is determined by how fast the circuit switches between zero and one. Unlike other circuits for the 1-bit computer, the clock is made possible by utilizing the electrical properties of a resistor + capacitor combination, called the *Schmitt-Trigger*. The NAND gate is bridged via a variable resistor, which can change the amount of current required to make that route available to the circuit. A capacitor between the ground and the logic input allows sufficient charge to build up behind the resistor to periodically cross the potential boundary. ```[we should talk this through, starts getting difficult to parse from here]``` The other input is connected to the power source, which eliminates the second input having 0 or False as the signal, turning NAND gate. The Input and Output of this gate is designed to have different value, but it's delayed by the resistor and capacitor. The Schimitt-Trigger makes enables the logic gate to remain unaffected until it is connected to the input ```???```
