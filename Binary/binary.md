Structure 

1. Define 1-bit computer (Adder + Memory + Clock)
2. Introduce electronic friends 
3. Binary logic (AND, NAND)
4. 1-bit computer with NAND logic gates 
5. Summary 


Notes on the Structure 

1. "Now let's make a computer! Wait, what is a computer? Computer can do math (like adding, subtracting, multiplying), remember information over time. It also has clocks which is very important. Computers, even in itssimpliest form will have all of these functionalities. We are going to use electronics to make it into a circuit".      
2. "Say Hi to the electronic friends!" Meet Breadboard, Battery (Voltage and Current), Switch (On and Off), Transistor (NPN), LED and Push button and potentiometer. TTL stands for "Transistor Transistor Logic" which is a combination of Transistors to create logical operations. 
3. Break from the technical details, change tones slightly. Brief mention of Claude Shannon's paper on switching circuits and George Boole' logic. Explain Binary with Thumbs up & down and Venn Diagram. Also introduce Integrated Circuit and the idea of abstraction here.   
4. Step by Step of making a 1-bit computer. Using the universal Logic of NAND & NOR. Interactive components come in here.    
5. Summary and transition to next chapter. "This is how computers work on the conceptual level. However, 1-bit computer can not do alot of useful computation, and it can't even be programmed per se. Thus we need to look at how modern computers use abstraction and repeptition of Logic to make something that is arguably close to Computer".
