##To our friends 


It would not be completely true if I say this project was a political one. However, it would be untrue to say this was an aesthetic or technical project without political agenda. Instead, I think I might have naively hoped that the technical project can be aesthetic and political at once. To be honest, I don't think I've succeeded in making political aspect clear to the viewer. Or if so, only slightly and shyly. 

As I wrap up the first stage of the project through compiling notes, drawings, video and the objects in the installation, I begin to rethink about the political nature of Handmade computer and the concept of Personal Computing. 


"The figure of the hacker contrasts point by point with the figure of the engineer, whatever the artistic, police-directed, or entrepreneurial efforts to neutralize him may be. Whereas the engineer would capture everything that functions, in such a way that everything functions
better in service to the system, the hacker asks himself “How does that work?” in order to find its flaws, but also to invent other uses, to experiment. Experimenting then means exploring what such and such a technique implies ethically. The hacker pulls techniques out of the technological system in order to free them. If we are slaves of technology, this is precisely because there is a whole ensemble of artifacts of our everyday existence that we take to be specifically “technical” and that we will always regard simply as black boxes of which we are the innocent users. The use of computers to attack the CIA attests rather clearly that cybernetics is no more the science of computers than astronomy is the science of telescopes. Understanding how the devices around us work brings an immediate increase in power, giving us a purchase on what will then no longer appear as an environment, but as a world arranged in a certain way and one that we can shape. This is the hacker’s perspective on the world."

So a letter to our friends who inspired this project, and possibly the friends who will complete (or continually grow it)
