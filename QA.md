###Q: Why did you make the computer with Logic Gates?  

**A:** I decided to make a computer with Logic Gates I.C. because it's a good place between completely raw material like mechanical computer like Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, early electronic computer with Vacuum tubes and Transistors. With working with I.C.s, I still get to learn about the computation as a theory, and also have the freedom to design and build based on architecture. Also one big caveat is that there are many resources out there to build computer from logic gates, as there was a short period in the development between completely Hardware based computer and microcontrollers, like 8080 and other programmable hardwares where people began to write software. It's also the time at the verge of mass production which lead to the idea of personal computers emerged and became popular. It's also a good teaching tool.
