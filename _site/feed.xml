        <title>Draft for Avant/Rhizome!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a draft for an online piece about Handmade Computer. It will be copublished between &lt;a href=&quot;http://avant.org&quot;&gt;Avant.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rhizome.org&quot;&gt;Rhizome.org&lt;/a&gt; in early September with few interactive components and design updates. 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since few years ago, I’ve been making primitive computers with discrete components and digital logic Integrated Circuits. I also made comics and teaching tools to help myself and students understand the fundamentals of computation. Big part of this project was developed for the School for poetic computation. 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note I had a very little understanding of computers and electronics when I started this and the project was possible only because of great help of many friends. Before I publish this piece to a wider audience, I’d like to ask my friends one more time for their advise and expertise. 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give me feedback via email [taeyoon at sfpc dot io] for technical clarifiaction, grammars and general flow from the readers’ perspective. You are invited to correct any error or clarify by forking or commenting on these repo.  To keep the latest version of edits up to date, I ask all edits to be made on the markdown document in github, instead of this draft. Thank you :)&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways of defining a computer other than the desktop, laptop, or smartphone. The “computer,” on a fundamental level is a tool that can do mathematical operations like add and multiply, remember information and follow instructions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/745/20582176698_da51529e9a_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a silicon valley folklore that centers around protagonists like Jobs, Wozniak, a mythology of innovation. But what’s left out of this glossy narrative are parallel stories about militarization, state power, and mass production, which provided the right political conditions and financed the computer’s invention. [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before computers became personal, they were used as tools for scientific research and engineering, as technologies to scale growing electronic communication systems and as machines for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday we look at computer screens for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3786/12623364165_4fc3315269_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We touch them, carry them, and sleep next to them.
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives are stored in bits, our messages turned to network packets, our living spaces are pixels.
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/469/18311063313_edbaf8e993_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have some knowledge about how to use a computer. But we have a limited understanding of the inner workings, what happens behind the screen and the colorful user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, computers perform all the complex tasks we’re familiar with through a few simple operations, repeated and abstracted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5757/20497682388_231bd20b52_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minimalists painters were interested in more than just the formal qualities of the painting, such as color and shape. They were also interested in the systems in which their work is created. Their working process emphasized making &lt;em&gt;programs&lt;/em&gt;, sets of instructions that, when executed, resulted in both a performative action and production of the artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5652/20858537691_ebe368b805_o.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a microscopic image of a microchip (resistor-transistor flip-flop logic [1]) from 1963. Images like these reveal the visual patterns of the interior circuitry which, designed for engineering purposes, are also quite geometrically appealing. They remind me of Frank Stella, Sol Lewitt, and the work other minimalist artists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/703/20884034731_b40b344d58_o.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image is a painting by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peterhalley.com/&quot;&gt;Peter Halley&lt;/a&gt; titled Instant City[2]. Halley’s work not only reminds me of microchips, but also computer design patterns such as the Von Neumann architecture which we will touch on in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/tree/master/Dumpling&quot;&gt;CPU Dumpling Shop&lt;/a&gt; chapter coming up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phrase “Each one comes to be a whole one to me” is from &lt;em&gt;The Making of Americans&lt;/em&gt; by Gertrude Stein. I opened a random page in the book and picked this line, so it could have been any other phrase. In this book, a story is told and retold in many ways. The result is a fragmented narrative with multiple perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/20823369765_30e3a61dd6_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paintings, circuits, and books all make use of repetition. Layering shapes or wires or pages, the composition and logic of which allow them to function as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3940/15752018125_41037ef0c6_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now going to cut a small hole into the abstracted form and jump into the world of zero and one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7541/15566849007_edcf431bec_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a computer and building electronic circuits feels like building a tiny city. The circuit board is a little urban architecture and its inhabitants a busy traffic of electronic signals. Just like cities, memories are made and remembered in the buildings and roads connecting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/blob/master/Binary/readme.md&quot;&gt;ZERO &amp;amp; ONE ⇒&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt; has the fundamental abilities of the traditional computer. It can perfom &lt;em&gt;artithmetic&lt;/em&gt;, add two single digit numbers and return a two digit output. It has a &lt;em&gt;clock&lt;/em&gt; that creates a square wave oscillation, turning on and off an LED at varying speed. And it has &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt;, a latch that can store 1-bit of information, a zero or a one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5744/20578210488_c5016e6191_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/136769465?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt; is made of NAND logic gates. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5667/20256616333_9961ff1b9b_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAND is short for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; AND logic. Here A and B are inputs, either of which can be zero or one, and Y is the logical output. In the venn diagram above depicting possible input state configurations, every shape is colored except the intersecting region. This means the result is true in every case &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; when both inputs are true.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the details of &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt;, Let’s return to the idea of Zero and One, Binary numbers and Boolean Logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5761/20794424050_7d5864e2dc_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining NAND gates in various arrangements we are able to make every other logic pattern. This is called the &lt;em&gt;universal gate&lt;/em&gt;, because along with the NOR gate, NAND can be combined to map any input instruction to any output. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5820/20361778943_2ee62221a9_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/620/20773146321_b0c6b10767_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 1 bit computer uses two TTL NAND logic chips, which are integrated circuit chips designed to perform NAND operations. The same logic could be implemented with transistors, vacuum tubes, or few lines of code in most programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/774/20812984222_590f7b06e4_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can click on the switches to see the Half Adder working, it adds one digits of number.  &lt;code&gt;[This is where interactive component comes in.]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/20990175911_2ceb98c8c6_b.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With XOR and AND gates combined, we can make an adder. Adders add numbers. So in the world of binary numbers, where every number is made of zeros and ones, the output of the addition would be 10, not ten but “one, zero.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0+0=0 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0+1=1  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1+0=1  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1+1=10 (2 in decimal notation)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last case, where the sum of 1+1, 10 requires we carry the 1 over to the next place, the next digit is fed to the AND gate, and the first digit acts like an XOR gate. By combining both logic gates, we can make an adding machine, called a &lt;em&gt;half adder&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/20812986422_ee5529c19d_b.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second basic computing operation is data storage, remembering information in bits. We are going to create the most primitive form of computer memory, where an input &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; can turn on or off an LED output, &lt;em&gt;Q bar&lt;/em&gt;. If the reset switch is then toggled, &lt;em&gt;switch&lt;/em&gt; is assigned to 1, and next time the &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; is made 1 and the LED output will remain lit even when &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; is no longer pressed. A latch works by connecting output of the NAND logic gate to input of another NAND logic gate. This is a sequential circuit, in which the output is affected by the input that was previously made. So the two inputs are called &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; because they can be used interchangeably. A circuit like this is called a flip-flop as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5800/20822480345_604712427c_b.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Interactive part: You can turn the knob by dragging the mouse to change the frequency.]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary clock simply switches between zero and one, visible to us as ‘LED not lit,’ and then ‘LED lit.’ The period in which the LED blinks, or the clock cycle, is determined by how fast the circuit switches between zero and one. The clock is made possible by utilizing the electrical properties of the specific kinds of NAND logic gate chips (CD4093 or 74132) called the &lt;em&gt;Schmitt-Trigger&lt;/em&gt; which delays the response time of the logic based on a threshold. By creating a network of variable resistor and capacitor between the input and output of the logic, NAND gate oscillates between Zero and One to produce constant frequency, also know as a clock signal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/blob/master/Dumpling/readme.md&quot;&gt;CPU DUMPLING SHOP ⇒&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/586/20286266173_8bfb8c0128_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, that kind of makes sense, right?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20719423348_6d895e5e3f_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not really….” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it did make sense, the &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite explain how your laptop or smartphone actually works.  Instead, &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt; demontrates that Binary numbers and Boolean Logic can be configured to create the fundamental building blocks of computer. However, it’s not capable of computing in anything significantly useful.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some help from the Internet or friend with experience, everyone can buy CPU, graphics card, RAM and other parts and assemble their own computer. However, it’s becoming increasingly rare for people to build their own personal computer because laptop, desktop and mobile computers that are completely ready for the end users are common and accesible. These modern computers are very powerful and can compute many bits of information in a fraction of a second, way more bits than our &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All this talk is making me hungry. I’m really craving some dumplings!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/20719119500_7c8baf02f1_z.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the School for Poetic Computation, we like to have dumplings for lunch. C &amp;amp; C Prosperity Dumpling is right around the corner from our space in the Lower East Side.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  walk in to the shop super hungry, ready for some sizzling dumplings. There’s a nice guy who works there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/726/20286138513_9e77baf055_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at the menu and decide to get pork and chive dumplings. I ask the man at the counter for 5 boiled dumplings and pay $1. He writes down my order on a piece of paper and puts it on the counter next to all the previous orders.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/743/20774209011_a520def1b5_o.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turns around, packs up a few vegetable dumplings, and gives them to the customer who came before me. Then he puts some pork and chive dumplings in the pot. I wonder if he’s making my order already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/710/20719118860_dc7ed0b3b2_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wait impatiently for my food, he takes in more orders from other customers. And then cooks some more dumplings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/20899984062_b7d9bd86c1_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the back kitchen, I see other people making more dumplings from scratch. There’s a person peeling onions, another person cutting chives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/664/20914465181_c424e1e81a_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another person is folding the dumplings with the filling inside. All of them are busy doing their part to make our orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/691/20286546343_58ed41741b_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pots and pans full of dumplings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5788/20720686570_9025eb3d88_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says my food is ready, packs up my order into a container, and hands it to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/578/20909824495_8d0b39aa90_b.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah! Dumpling time! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dumpling shop can be a metaphor to help us underatand the most important part of the computer, the central processing unit (also known as the CPU). The most common CPU design is called the ‘Von Neumann architecture,’ named after John von Neumann, the mathematician who invented it in 1945. Although computer technology has advanced dramatically since then, the conceptual framework for the CPU has remained largely unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/20311593064_44718b69c4_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Von Neumann architecture is based on a CPU that has &lt;em&gt;control unit&lt;/em&gt; and an &lt;em&gt;arithmetic logic unit&lt;/em&gt;. These two units communicate with the &lt;em&gt;memory unit&lt;/em&gt; when it’s instructed by an input. The output of this operation is communicated through output device. This architecture makes it possible to store programs in the computer, where programs and data in memory can be treated interchangeably. In other words, this functionality to store information and call it as an instruction distinguishes the computers from electronic calculators, which can perform mathematical operations but have limited ability to store and recall programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5773/20825301555_0ecf439c0a_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the CPU Dumpling Shop, whenever a customer orders food, the information about their order is considered a single instruction set.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chef knows the whole menu as well as which cabinets the ingredients are stored. He remembers the recipe for making dumplings in his long term memory, he doesn’t think about them every second, but he can remember when needed. He also reads all the customers orders and keeps them in his working memory, he’s likely to forget them in few minutes. The process by which the chef remembers the important bits of the dumpling orders, computers store instructions and working information in their memory.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a second kind of memory in the computer, like how the raw ingredients for the dumplings are stored further away in the kitchen, the chef can pick these up anytime he needs. Some data is stored in the storage, which is basically the same as memory except it contains information that’s only used once in a while. The information in the computer memory is temporary and used constantly for short periods of time, and the information in storage is kept for a very long time, just like our memories.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5715/20893802212_7ed4646651_h.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device is named “Finite State machine” because it has a limited amount of memory for holding information the user inputs. I designed this to better understand the important components and concepts that make up the CPU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/122206226&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; This video is going to be fixed with a short dedicated video for FSM]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;input--output&quot;&gt;Input &amp;amp; Output&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four buttons in the front are the inputs which you can use to enter four bits of information. If the button is pressed, the information is 1 or High and an LED right in front of the button lights up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four LEDs on the back are the outputs. This is where information stored in the the RAM (Random Access Memory) is made visible. It’s the visual output for the finite state machine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ram&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAM is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/fairchild/74F189.pdf&quot;&gt;74189 chip&lt;/a&gt;, 64-Bit Random Access Memory. More on the nature of RAM on the next chapter on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/tree/master/RAMcity&quot;&gt;RAM City&lt;/a&gt;. 
The small red switch on the left enables you to select between reading or writing the data from the input to the RAM. When the switch is in writing mode, status of the switches (either on and off) is recorded on the RAM as four bits of information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counter&quot;&gt;Counter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small yellow switch on the right controls the counter which counts from zero to nine, ten states where four bits of information can be recorded. When the switch is toggled, the number decreases from nine to zero. Imagine of an elevator that does from the ground floor to the 9th floor that can go up or down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/666/20677709442_6f380d215d_k.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blue button next to the Counter control is a load. If this switch is enabled, you can load the information stored in the RAM. This is possible by switching on and off the load switches behind the chip. The binary information from the switches gives you a random access to the information the R.A.M. When it’s not on the load mode, the RAM can cycle through the ten steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/695/20719117620_31be865dcf_b.jpg =400x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Finite State Machine demonstrates how the instructions and information are stored in memory. However it doesn’t explain how the computer calculates information, or to continue with our dumpling metaphor, how the chef actually cooks the dumplings. The mathematical and logical operations are made possible with the ALU, which stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/20876342206_4c0a7dcde4_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ALU is responsible for all mathematics and logical operations, like comparing two bits of information, multiplying, or subtracting. It performs all artithmetic calculations and logical decisions. Since computers only think and speak in binary numbers, ALU also only deals with the truth or falsity of operations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5626/20313162303_a0112be8ff_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really fascinating about the ALU and the computers in general is that they are made for binary logic gates. ALU, which performs complex operations is still made of basic logic gates, as you as see on the diagram above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5696/20364771063_4c0aa7f838_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the chef grills dumplings on the pan, or packs up the cooked food, he’s acting like the control unit. The control unit is in charge of coordination the operation of all the other components. It is the in charge of signalling the hardware devieces to to execute instructions. The ALU and the control unit together make up the CPU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/blob/master/RAMcity/readme.md&quot;&gt;RAM City ⇒&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15750679268_d0c73f9a5f_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are getting a new computer, quiet often we hear about how much RAM is inside of the computer. You can’t really fit a sheep inside of a computer, so it must be something different. We usually understand having more RAM means the computer can do more things at the same time. RAM is memory but it’s different from Hard disk space in the computer, which is where all the software and data lives. Then, what is RAM exactly? 
It stands for Random Access Memory. We can think of a parking lot with 8 parking spots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3872/14630594145_edc4ca6e67_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Parking lot has one gate that’s both entrance and exit for the cars. The gate is controlled by a binray clock that’s either closed on Zero state, or open on One state. There are eight parking spaces because our RAM can store up to 8-bits of Information. The Input can take in  Data, like a car waiting to come in to the parking lot. However the car can not go to a parking space which already has a car on it. To prevent this, the giant display on the back displays if a parking space is occupied or vacant. The cars can get out of the parking lot, which is like erasing the data that’s been stored in the specific parking space. It’s achieved when the gate is open, Zero (which means no car) is signalled into the Input. The circuit assigns the value of Zero to the Parking space. Now new car can come in to that space. Also the path between the parking space and the gate is really narrow and only one car can come in and out at a time. The combination of clock, mux, demux and flipflops complete a 9-bit Random Access memory, where Data can be written and read asynchronously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/655/20889869441_19e63ce7cb_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Parking spaces are made of D-Type flip flops. D stands for Data and Delay and it’s a type of digital memory like the SR latch we made earlier for the &lt;em&gt;1 Bit Computer&lt;/em&gt;. However it has additional input for clock signal. This is a latch that only change the Flip-Flop when the Clock input is on the rising edge. Therefore, even when there’s a change in the Data input, if the clock signal is Low, or Zero, the Flip-Flop will not accept the new data. This delay feature also enables the Flip-Flop to hold data as long as the clock signal remains High or the address input (which is routed by the DEMUX) has been changed to another Flip-Flop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/614/20695978869_4907925e5a_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top line is called “Clock” which is a constant wave of High and Low, One and Zeros that control the Flip-Flop. The second line is Data, which is an Input. At the rising edge of the Clock signal A, Data is also High which results in Q becoming also High. At the end of the cycle A, Data is Low, but Q remains the same because Q only changes state on the rising edge. This factor enables us to hold the data over time and have it erase itself at the end of the clock cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gate which controls the entrance and exit of the cars in the parking lok is a lot like the Multiplexer and De-multiplexer, which is conveniently called MUX and DeMUX. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14375838297_c42dab45a7_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUX has many inputs and the selector inputs. Depending on how the selector inputs (like the Thumbs Up or Down in the drawing), the output Data is assigned to different input. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/14560631144_30ef4dddc6_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demux works exactly the opposite of Mux. It’s made of one input, four binary switches and many outputs. The combination of Thumbs up and down change the logic within the demux and route that one input to 16 outputs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:(  “Ok this is too confusing. What is MUX do again?” 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20719423348_6d895e5e3f_b.jpg =200x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5775/20706120532_578cac3552_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember a smart thing at a fancy grocery store or airport where the display lets you know which station you should go? It’s when there are few lines of people waiting, and the display shows whichever station that’s open, and assigns the person in the front of the line to that station and then jump to the next line. It’s not a perfect analogy because the real multiplexer only has one input, so all the lines would be a single line. However, the part about the displays showing where to go is quiet similar.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/14630595245_7ea41be283_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2918/14642585333_028c3324d5_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wiring the 8 Bit RAM on a breadboard, I used 2 D-type Flip-flop chips, one MUX and DEMUX and one 555 Timer to generate signal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14626353221_caae6df4e2_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to do is connect DEMUX with three input swithces A, B and C. Also it needs to be connected to the Clock signal. Data input needs to be connected to all the Data inputs of D type flip flops. It’s imporatant that the Data line is connected to all of the inputs of the Flip-Flops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3923/14443190747_86c8f2d880_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second step is to connect DEMUX outputs to all of the clock inputs of the Flip-Flops. Now we know that the DEMUX is really assigning the clock’s signal to all of the D Type Flip-Flops individually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3882/14629137692_c29f415a21_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step is to connect the Outputs of all individual Flip-Flops to the MUX. The Ouputs are called Q on the Flip Flops and it’s connected to from D0to D7 in the MUX, 8 bits of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14442989638_2a42bd8375_k.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth step is to create an oscillator with 555 Chip. It’s using capacitor and resistor similar to the Schimitt-Trigger oscillator we made earlier. We connect the output of the clock to a switch that alternate between Clock signal and READ mode. On Read mode, the switch is connected to the ground, which means the DEMUX is in passive mode (there might be a more correct way to say this!) and this is how we know if the parking spaces are occupied or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, we need to connect the output of the MUX into an LED. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/709/20695472168_71da556ea6_b.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/113169467&quot;&gt;video demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of 8 bit RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14444232477_45bef3c378_o.jpg =600x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are wiring this many wires to make an electornic circuit, you are bound to find time to think about a lot of things. I kept on thinking I’m building a tiny city. Each Flip-Flop is an apartment building that’s either occupied or vacant. DEMUX is like a giant terminal that all bus and cars go through, and all the connection between logic gates are like Highways. There are some roads that are used more frequently than others, some for high speed and others which are like more local roads. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around that time, I found a a book of poems about cities by Donna Stonecipher. The whole book continues like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and instantly feeling the burden of ownership, the keys weighing down your coat pocket so severely you start dreaming of giving them back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was like dreaming that you are given the keys to a model city and then you get into your royal blue car and drive out to the outskirts of town to leave the keys on an unoccupied bench overlooking a lake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was like dreaming that you drive back home unburdened, enter your house with its key and sit down with a sigh on your bed, in the quiet and dark, until you notice that the keys to the model city are back in your pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was like waking suddenly from the dream, seeing your house key on its hook, and luxuriating in the freedom from keys to model cities — in the deep ease of the haphazard and the habitual, the half-assed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Model City [7] by Donna Stonecipher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a painting of the Random Access City on the studio wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tchoi8/handmadecomputer/blob/master/Extra/Manifesto.md&quot;&gt;Handamde Computer Manifesto ⇒&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Sometime near future, we will be making our own computers, out of desire as well as necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution of the next generation technologies will happen in parallel with reflection and reconsideration of the obsolete technologies, craft and value and the vision. 
Human, the tool-bearers will claim ownership of the tools by all means. 
The tool, the human alter-ego will become aware of its autonomy and its ability to shape its future as well as the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: I avoid making speculative work on the shiny ‘Technological Future’  because so much of the contemporary culture already reproduces the future. Speculation can be a dirty word, especially when it’s used around the malicious practices in finance and technological enterprises.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUTURE&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as an abstract concept is a pure form of commodity. In the world where fiction feels more real than the lived experience, I’m concerned with the Technological-Futuristic tendencies associated with the commodity products. Can we create work for the future without providing more ideas and language to be capitalized by the incumbent system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: The technological products that promise ‘personalization’ are often misleading the users into believing the customization means ownership. The user experience is designed to deliver gratifying sense of ‘Coming into one’ with the device. The One is the reflection on the black mirror, our, the users’ alter-ego. We own the reflection on the surface, not the device and the content. The mystery of personalization remains within the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4: Becoming a computer. 
By making a computer, we are connecting with a computer as in becoming ONE entity with it. By becoming one with the computer, it becomes more similar to us.&lt;br /&gt;
The question quickly shifted from “Can I build a computer” to “What kind of computer do I want to build?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5: Opening the Black box.
Also, this is less of a question about what happened in the 1920s - 30s - 60s - 70s… but more a question of what do I (we) want to happen in the future? The future I am presenting here is absolutely not the market driven speculation, but a I envision a Future where we coexist with technology.  &lt;/p&gt;
