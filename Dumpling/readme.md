"Well, that kind of makes sense, right?"

"Not really...." 


Even if it made some sense, 1-bit computer doesn't fully explain how the computers actually work. After many technical breakthroughs and industry's changing needs, computer evolved into the modern computers which we use daily for all kinds of needs.

Eversince Laptop computers became more powerful and popular, it's becoming increasingly rare for most users to build their own Personal Computer. However, everyone can buy CPU, Graphics card, RAM and other parts and assemble their own computers.  These modern computers are very powerful and can compute many bits of information on the slice of second. 


 
"All this talk is making me hungry. I craving some dumplings so much!"

At the School for poetic computation, we like to have dumplings for lunch. [C & C Prosperity Dumpling](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prosperity-dumpling-new-york-2) is right around the corner from our space in the Lower East Side.  
</br>
 

I  walk in to the shop, super hungry and ready for some sizzling dumplings. There's a nice guy who works there.

I look at the menu and decide to get pork and chives dumplings. I ask the guy at the counter for 5 boiled dumplings and pay $1. He writes down your order on a piece of paper and put it on the counter next to previous orders.

He turns around and packs up few vegetable dumplings and give it to a customer who came before me. He then cooks pork and chives dumplings on the pot. I wonder if it's already my order.

There are number of customers who have been already waiting for their orders.  
 

 While I wait impatiently for the food, he takes in more orders from other customers.  And then cooks some more dumplings.

 On the back of the kitchen, I see other people making more dumplings from scratch. There's a person who's peeling onion, another person cutting the chives.

Another person making the dumplings by folding a flour skin into a shell like shape. All of them are busy and continuing to do their job.

There are pans and also pots that are making dumplings.

  He says your food is ready.  And he packs up my order into a container and hand it to me.

  Oh yeah! Dumpling Time!

This Dumpling Shop can be a metaphor to underatand the most important part in a computer, the Central Processing Unit, also known as CPU. The most common design of a CPU is called 'Von Neumann architecture' named after John von Neumann, a scientist who engineered the concept in 1945. Although computer technology has advanced dramatically since then, the conceptual framework of the CPU has remained largely similar to this concept. 

 </br>

 </br>

The Von Neumann architecture is based on a CPU that has Control Unit and Arithmetic Logic Unit. These two units communicate with Memory Unit when it's instructed by an Input. The output of its operation is communicated through Output device. This architecture makes it possible to store programs in the computer, where programs and data in memory can be treated interchangeably. In other words, this functionality to store information and call it as an instruction distinguishes the computers from electronic calculators, which can perform mathematic operations but has limited ability to store and recall programs.

At the CPU Dumpling Shop, whenever a customer orders food, the information about their order is considered as a set of data entered into the input.  

The chef knows all the menu and which cabinets in the refrigerator the ingredients are stored. He remembers the recipe for making dumplings in his long term memory, he doesn't think about them every second but he can remember it when needed. He also remembers what the customers have ordered in his working memory, he's likely to forget them in few minutes. Much like how all of this information is stored in his memory, computers store instructions and data in its memory.   

However, there's a different kind of memory in computer like how the raw ingredients for the dumplings are stored farther away in the kitchen and the chef can pick it up anytime he needs it. Some data are stored in the Storage which is basically the same as memory except it contains information that's only used once in a while. Also, the information in the computer memory is temporary and it's used constantly while it's needed and the information in the Storage is kept permanently.

This device is named "Finite State machine" because it has a limited number of memory that can hold the information a user inputs. It's a nifty little machine that has many important components that make up CPU. 

#####Input & Output

The four buttons in the front are the Inputs which you can use to enter four bits of Information. If the button is pressed, the information is 1 or High and a LED right infront of the button lights up immediately. You can input four bits of Information at the same time. 
  
  
The four LEDs on the back are the Outputs. It's where the Information stored in the the RAM(Random Access Memory) is made visible. It's the visual output for the Finite State Machine.  

##### R.A.M. 

The small red switch on the left is a enables you to select between Reading or Writing the Data from the Input to the RAM. When the switch is in Writing mode, the whichever combination the switches are pressed is recorded on the RAM. When 
  
####Counter
The small yellow switch on the right controls the counter which counts from Zero to Nine, ten states where four bits of Information can be recorded. When the switch is selected in other way, the number decreases from Nine to Zero. 
  
   
The blue button next to the Counter control is a Load. If this switch is enabled, you can load the information that's stored in the RAM. This is possible by switching on and off the Load switches behind the chip. The binary information from the switches give you a Random Access to the Information the R.A.M. When it's not on the Load mode, the RAM cycles through the ten steps.

  That explains how the instructions and informations are stored in memory. However it doesn't explain how the Computer calculates information, or to continue with our Dumpling metaphor, how the chef actually cooks the dumplings. The mathematical and logical operations are made possible with ALU, which stands to Arithmetic Logic Unit. 

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/20876342206_4c0a7dcde4_b.jpg =600x)
 
ALU is responsible for all mathematics and logical operations, like comparing two informations, multiplying and subtracting. It performs all artithmetic calculations and logical decisions.  Since computers only think and speak in Binary numbers, ALU also only deals with truth or false of operations.  

When the chef grills dumplings on the pan, or packs up the cooked food, he's acting like the Control Unit. Control Unit is in charge of coordination the operation of all the other components.It is the in charge of signalling the hardware devies to to execute instructions. Together with ALU, Control Unit makes up the processor in CPU.
