"Well, that kind of makes sense, right?"

"Not really...." 


Even if it did make sense, the 1-bit computer doesn't quite explain how your laptop or smartphone actually works. After many technical breakthroughs and changing demand for computing tools, computers have evolved into the devices which we now use on a daily basis.

Ever since laptop computers became more powerful and more popular, it's also become increasingly rare for people to build their own personal computer. However, everyone can buy CPU, graphics card, RAM and other parts and assemble their own computers. These modern computers are very powerful and can compute many bits of information in a fraction of a second.


 
"All this talk is making me hungry. I'm really craving some dumplings!"

At the School for Poetic Computation, we like to have dumplings for lunch. C & C Prosperity Dumpling is right around the corner from our space in the Lower East Side.  
</br>
 

I  walk in to the shop super hungry, ready for some sizzling dumplings. There's a nice guy who works there.

I look at the menu and decide to get pork and chive dumplings. I ask the guy at the counter for 5 boiled dumplings and pay $1. He writes down my order on a piece of paper and puts it on the counter next to all the the previous orders.

He turns around, packs up a few vegetable dumplings, and gives them to the customer who came before me. He then puts some pork and chive dumplings in the pot. I wonder if he's making my order already.

There are number of customers who have been waiting for their orders.  
 

While I wait impatiently for my food, he takes in more orders from other customers. And then cooks some more dumplings.

In the back kitchen, I see other people making more dumplings from scratch. There's a person peeling onions, another person cutting chives.

Another person is folding the dumplings with the filling inside. All of them are busy doing their part to make our orders.

There are pans and pots making dumplings.

He says your food is ready, packs up my order into a container, and hands it to me.

 Oh yeah! Dumpling time! 
 
 



This dumpling shop can be a metaphor to underatand the most important part of the computer, the central processing unit, also known as CPU. The most common CPU design is called the 'Von Neumann architecture' named after John von Neumann, the mathematician who invented the design in 1945. Although computer technology has advanced dramatically since then, the conceptual framework of the CPU has remained largely unchanged.



![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/20311593064_44718b69c4_b.jpg =600x)




The Von Neumann architecture is based on a CPU that has *control unit* and an *arithmetic logic unit*. These two units communicate with the *memory unit* when it's instructed by an input. The output of this operation is communicated through output device. This architecture makes it possible to store programs in the computer, where programs and data in memory can be treated interchangeably. In other words, this functionality to store information and call it as an instruction distinguishes the computers from electronic calculators, which can perform mathematic operations but has limited ability to store and recall programs.

At the CPU Dumpling Shop, whenever a customer orders food, the information about their order is considered as a set of data entered into the input.  

The chef knows all the menu and which cabinets in the refrigerator the ingredients are stored. He remembers the recipe for making dumplings in his long term memory, he doesn't think about them every second but he can remember it when needed. He also remembers what the customers have ordered in his working memory, he's likely to forget them in few minutes. Much like how all of this information is stored in his memory, computers store instructions and data in its memory.   

However, there's a different kind of memory in computer like how the raw ingredients for the dumplings are stored farther away in the kitchen and the chef can pick it up anytime he needs it. Some data are stored in the Storage which is basically the same as memory except it contains information that's only used once in a while. Also, the information in the computer memory is temporary and it's used constantly while it's needed and the information in the Storage is kept permanently.

This device is named "Finite State machine" because it has a limited number of memory that can hold the information a user inputs. It's a nifty little machine that has many important components that make up CPU. 

#####Input & Output

The four buttons in the front are the Inputs which you can use to enter four bits of Information. If the button is pressed, the information is 1 or High and a LED right infront of the button lights up immediately. You can input four bits of Information at the same time. 
  
  
The four LEDs on the back are the Outputs. It's where the Information stored in the the RAM(Random Access Memory) is made visible. It's the visual output for the Finite State Machine.  

##### R.A.M. 

The small red switch on the left is a enables you to select between Reading or Writing the Data from the Input to the RAM. When the switch is in Writing mode, the whichever combination the switches are pressed is recorded on the RAM. When 
  
####Counter
The small yellow switch on the right controls the counter which counts from Zero to Nine, ten states where four bits of Information can be recorded. When the switch is selected in other way, the number decreases from Nine to Zero. 
  
   
The blue button next to the Counter control is a Load. If this switch is enabled, you can load the information that's stored in the RAM. This is possible by switching on and off the Load switches behind the chip. The binary information from the switches give you a Random Access to the Information the R.A.M. When it's not on the Load mode, the RAM cycles through the ten steps.

  That explains how the instructions and informations are stored in memory. However it doesn't explain how the Computer calculates information, or to continue with our Dumpling metaphor, how the chef actually cooks the dumplings. The mathematical and logical operations are made possible with ALU, which stands to Arithmetic Logic Unit. 

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/20876342206_4c0a7dcde4_b.jpg =600x)
 
ALU is responsible for all mathematics and logical operations, like comparing two informations, multiplying and subtracting. It performs all artithmetic calculations and logical decisions.  Since computers only think and speak in Binary numbers, ALU also only deals with truth or false of operations.  

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5626/20313162303_a0112be8ff_b.jpg =600x)

What's really fascinating about the ALU and the computers in general is that they are really made for binary loigic gates. ALU, which performs complex operations are still made of basic logic gates, as you as see on the diagram above. 

When the chef grills dumplings on the pan, or packs up the cooked food, he's acting like the Control Unit. Control Unit is in charge of coordination the operation of all the other components.It is the in charge of signalling the hardware devies to to execute instructions. Together with ALU, Control Unit makes up the processor in CPU.
