"Well, that kind of makes sense, right?"

"Not really...." 


Even if it did make sense, the 1-bit computer doesn't quite explain how your laptop or smartphone actually works. After many technical breakthroughs and changing demand for computing tools, computers have evolved into the devices which we now use on a daily basis.

Ever since laptop computers became more powerful and more popular, it's also become increasingly rare for people to build their own personal computer. However, everyone can buy CPU, graphics card, RAM and other parts and assemble their own computers. These modern computers are very powerful and can compute many bits of information in a fraction of a second.


 
"All this talk is making me hungry. I'm really craving some dumplings!"

At the School for Poetic Computation, we like to have dumplings for lunch. C & C Prosperity Dumpling is right around the corner from our space in the Lower East Side.

I  walk in to the shop super hungry, ready for some sizzling dumplings. There's a nice guy who works there.

I look at the menu and decide to get pork and chive dumplings. I ask the man at the counter for 5 boiled dumplings and pay $1. He writes down my order on a piece of paper and puts it on the counter next to all the previous orders.

He turns around, packs up a few vegetable dumplings, and gives them to the customer who came before me. Then he puts some pork and chive dumplings in the pot. I wonder if he's making my order already.

While I wait impatiently for my food, he takes in more orders from other customers. And then cooks some more dumplings.

In the back kitchen, I see other people making more dumplings from scratch. There's a person peeling onions, another person cutting chives.

Another person is folding the dumplings with the filling inside. All of them are busy doing their part to make our orders.

There are pots and pans full of dumplings.

He says your food is ready, packs up my order into a container, and hands it to me.

 Oh yeah! Dumpling time! 
 
 



This dumpling shop can be a metaphor to help us underatand the most important part of the computer, the central processing unit (also known as the CPU). The most common CPU design is called the 'Von Neumann architecture,' named after John von Neumann, the mathematician who invented it in 1945. Although computer technology has advanced dramatically since then, the conceptual framework for the CPU has remained largely unchanged.



![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/20311593064_44718b69c4_b.jpg =600x)




The Von Neumann architecture is based on a CPU that has *control unit* and an *arithmetic logic unit*. These two units communicate with the *memory unit* when it's instructed by an input. The output of this operation is communicated through output device. This architecture makes it possible to store programs in the computer, where programs and data in memory can be treated interchangeably. In other words, this functionality to store information and call it as an instruction distinguishes the computers from electronic calculators, which can perform mathematical operations but have limited ability to store and recall programs.

At the CPU Dumpling Shop, whenever a customer orders food, the information about their order is considered a single instruction set.  

The chef knows the whole menu as well as which cabinets the ingredients are stored. He remembers the recipe for making dumplings in his long term memory, he doesn't think about them every second, but he can remember when needed. He also reads all the customers orders and keeps them in his working memory, he's likely to forget them in few minutes. The process by which the chef remembers the important bits of the dumpling orders, computers store instructions and working information in their memory.   

There's also a second kind of memory in the computer, like how the raw ingredients for the dumplings are stored further away in the kitchen, the chef can pick these up anytime he needs. Some data is stored in the storage, which is basically the same as memory except it contains information that's only used once in a while. The information in the computer memory is temporary and used constantly for short periods of time, and the information in storage is kept for a very long time, just like our memories.

This device is named "Finite State machine" because it has a limited amount of memory for holding information the user inputs. It's a nifty little machine that has many important components that make up the CPU. 

#####Input & Output

The four buttons in the front are the inputs which you can use to enter four bits of information. If the button is pressed, the information is 1 or High and an LED right in front of the button lights up immediately.


The four LEDs on the back are the outputs. This is where information stored in the the RAM (Random Access Memory) is made visible. It's the visual output for the finite state machine.  

##### R.A.M. 

The small red switch on the left enables you to select between reading or writing the data from the input to the RAM. When the switch is in writing mode, the sequence of turning switches on and off is recorded on the RAM.
  
####Counter
The small yellow switch on the right controls the counter which counts from zero to nine, ten states where four bits of information can be recorded. When the switch is toggled, the number decreases from nine to zero. 


The blue button next to the Counter control is a load. If this switch is enabled, you can load the information stored in the RAM. This is possible by switching on and off the load switches behind the chip. The binary information from the switches gives you a random access to the information the R.A.M. When it's not on the load mode, the RAM can cycle through the ten steps.

That explains how the instructions and information are stored in memory. However it doesn't explain how the computer calculates information, or to continue with our dumpling metaphor, how the chef actually cooks the dumplings. The mathematical and logical operations are made possible with the ALU, which stands for arithmetic logic unit. 

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/20876342206_4c0a7dcde4_b.jpg =600x)
 
The ALU is responsible for all mathematics and logical operations, like comparing two bits of information, multiplying, or subtracting. It performs all artithmetic calculations and logical decisions. Since computers only think and speak in binary numbers, ALU also only deals with the truth or falsity of operations.  

![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5626/20313162303_a0112be8ff_b.jpg =600x)

What's really fascinating about the ALU and the computers in general is that they are made for binary logic gates. ALU, which performs complex operations is still made of basic logic gates, as you as see on the diagram above. 

When the chef grills dumplings on the pan, or packs up the cooked food, he's acting like the control unit. The control unit is in charge of coordination the operation of all the other components. It is the in charge of signalling the hardware devieces to to execute instructions. The ALU and the control unit together make up the CPU.
