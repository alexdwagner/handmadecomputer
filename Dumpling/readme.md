"Well, that kind of makes sense, right?"

"Not really...." 


Even if it made some sense, 1-bit computer doesn't fully explain how the computers actually work. After many technical breakthroughs and industry's changing needs, computer evolved into the modern computers which we use daily for all kinds of needs.

Eversince Laptop computers became more powerful and popular, it's becoming increasingly rare for most users to build their own Personal Computer. However, everyone can buy CPU, Graphics card, RAM and other parts and assemble their own computers.  These modern computers are very powerful and can compute many bits of information on the slice of second. 


 
"All this talk is making me hungry. I craving some dumplings so much!"

At the School for poetic computation, we like to have dumplings for lunch. [C & C Prosperity Dumpling](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prosperity-dumpling-new-york-2) is right around the corner from our space in the Lower East Side.  
</br>
 


I  walk in to the shop, super hungry and ready for some sizzling dumplings. There's a nice guy who works there.

I look at the menu and decide to get pork and chives dumplings. I ask the guy at the counter for 5 boiled dumplings and pay $1. He writes down your order on a piece of paper and put it on the counter next to previous orders.

He turns around and packs up few vegetable dumplings and give it to a customer who came before me. He then cooks pork and chives dumplings on the pot. I wonder if it's already my order.

There are number of customers who have been already waiting for their orders.  
 

 While I wait impatiently for the food, he takes in more orders from other customers.  And then cooks some more dumplings.

 On the back of the kitchen, I see other people making more dumplings from scratch. There's a person who's peeling onion, another person cutting the chives.

Another person making the dumplings by folding a flour skin into a shell like shape. All of them are busy and continuing to do their job.

There are pans and also pots that are making dumplings.

  He says your food is ready.  And he packs up my order into a container and hand it to me.

  Oh yeah! Dumpling Time!

This Dumpling Shop can be a metaphor to underatand the most important part in a computer. The Central Processing Unit, also known as CPU, is the brain of computers. The most common design of a CPU is called 'Von Neumann architecture' named after John von Neumann, a scientist who engineered the concept in 1945. Although computer technology has advanced dramatically since then, the conceptual framework of the CPU has remained largely similar to this concept.

If we look at the dumpling shop as a CPU, when I ordered the five dumplings, it was data put into the input. The data was an order for five boiled dumplings. The chef knows all the menu and where the ingredients are stored in. Also he knows recipe for making more dumplings as well as what other customers have ordered before you arrived. All of this information is stored in his memory. The ingredients, frozen and prepared dumplings are farther away in the kitchen but it can be called back anytime he needs it. This is where the data is stored in the Storage, the difference between Memory and Storage is that Memory is more temporary and used constantly while it's needed, and the Storage is only called when there's a need for it. When he cooks the dumplings, he's performing operations like ALU, which stands to Arithmetic Logic Unit.

ALU does all mathematics and logical operations, like comparing two informations, multiplying and subtracting. When the chef grills dumplings on the pan, or packs up the cooked food, he's acting like the Control Unit is the in charge of signalling the hardware devies to to execute instructions. ALU, Control Unit and other functionalities like Memories make up the Central Processing Unit. When he hands you the hot and tasty dumplings, this is the Output of the CPU Dumpling Shop.

And then there are elements in the CPU. We can look at this device called "Finite State machine" to understand other elements. It's a nifty little machine that has many important components of the CPU.

  The four buttons in the front are Inputs. It's where you can input four bits of Information. If the button is pressed, an LED right infront of it lights up immediately and signals that the digit is 1. 
  
  The small red switch on the left is a enable selecting from Reading and Writing of the Data in to the RAM. 
  
  The small yellow switch on the right controls the counter which counts from Zero to 9, ten steps 
  
  The blue button is for Memory: It's function is to 
  
  The blue button next to the Counter control is a Load. If this switch is enabled, you can load the information that's stored in the RAM. 
  
  Four LEDs on the back are the Outputs.
