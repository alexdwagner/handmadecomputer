So we talk about the RAM quiet a lot, like how many Lamb is in the herd. What is RAM exactly? It stands for Random Access Memory.

it's made of D-Type flip flops. From the Wikipedia "The D flip-flop captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock /Users/tystudio/Documents/handmadecomputer/RAMcitycycle (such as the rising edge of the clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change."

The magic behind the working of RAM is the Multiplexer and De-multiplexer, which is conveniently called MUX and DeMUX.

Person - "Well, that's still pretty cryptic. I still don't understand much of this. 

Transistor - "Ok, let's try another analogy"
